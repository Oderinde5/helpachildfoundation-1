				<h2>Lets build a world without child abuse and neglect</h2>
				<p>
					Children are the most vulnerable members of society and they deserve and need our protection.
					Sexual predators and abusive parents make life intolerable for our young. Furthermore other
					societal challenges, such as poverty and crime all impact on the well-being, healthy
					development and safety of children.
					The Ratanka Foundation is playing an active role in the prevention of sexual violence, as well
					as the physical, emotional and spiritual care of children. Please get involved by sponsoring our
					programmes and making a difference in the lives of children.

						the needs of every individual, or group wishing to give their time, talents and efforts, to benefit
						underprivileged communities. We are a volunteer-friendly organization, providing opportunity for

					<h3>Give inspiration</h3>
					<p>
						We all know that all children, from all backgrounds, communities, and ways-of-life, deserve a
						great childhood because those children are our future. At the same time, we recognize that child
						abuse and neglect is a problem that affects children from all demographics as well.
						In other words, we believe that we can do more than reduce rates of abuse and neglect – we
						can prevent them from ever happening in the first place. Whoever you are, you can do something to make a difference.
